Phalcon Diff is an open source project and a volunteer effort.

*We only accept bug reports, new feature requests and pull requests in GitHub*.

Phalcon Diff does not have human resources fully dedicated to the maintenance of this software.
If you want something to be improved or you want a new feature please submit a Pull Request.

If you have a change or new feature in mind, please fill an [NFR][:nfr:].
**Note**: We don't add changes directly to stable branches or `master`.
So, if you are going to do a PR, use the dev-branch.

Thanks! <br />
Phalcon Team
